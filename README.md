# Headphones Landing Page

This is my implementation of the Headphones Landing Page project for the ALX Frontend track.  
I built this directly from a Figma design, matching every section, color, font, and layout detail — because clean design is personal to me.

## What This Project Is About

The goal was simple: take a Figma design and turn it into a real, working web page using pure HTML and CSS.  
No frameworks. No shortcuts. Just clean code and attention to detail.

This project helped me focus on:
- Responsive layouts  
- Font management  
- Hover and active states  
- Centering content properly (the real challenge)

## Design Details

- **Source file:** Figma (duplicate it to your drafts to explore layers and spacing)
- **Fonts used:**
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/spin-cycle-ot)

If the fonts don’t load, you can install them manually from those links.

Some design values were in floats — I rounded them for simplicity.
